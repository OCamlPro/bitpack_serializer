(** The Buffer defines the methods for serializers & deserializers in a

(** {1 Writer} *)

(** A writer is a {{: https://v2.ocaml.org/api/Bytes.html }Bytes} buffer where is
    written the data. It also contains an optional dictionary for string
    storage.
    It also holds statistics on the repartition of bits for each datatype
    (unsigned int, signed int and string). *)
type writer

(** Initializes a new buffer as a writer.
    If [with_dict] is set to [NoDictionary], strings will be written in the
    buffer.
    If [with_dict] is set to [Dictionary None] (by default), strings will be
    replaced by an unknown size integers; a disctionary will be saved and
    concatenated at the beginning of the buffer after finalization.
    If [with_dict] is set to [Dictionary (Some size)], it does the same than
    [Dictionary None] but it is assumed there will be no more than [size] words
    to save.
    registered in a dictionary (useful when the same string apprears at
    different places) and replaced by integers in the buffer.
    Variable [init_size] is the initial size of the writing bytes buffer
    (by default: 4096)

    Writes [v] on [buff] using [size] bits. Value must be positive.
